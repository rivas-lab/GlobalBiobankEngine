This file has missingness rate, allele frequency, and Hardy-Weinberg p-values
for the 500k release (though these values were calculated on the subset of
individuals we are using for GWAS). I took these values from the plink output
files. There are additional columns indicating whether a variant is specific to
either array. There are also columns for each filter. Some filters have been
applied to all variants while others have only been applied to a subset (often
the subset that we have annotated as PTVs). A 1 in a column means that the
variant did not pass that filter and should be removed. The final column
contains the number of filters a variant did not pass. So if a variant has a
zero in the final column, it passed all filters. The current filters are

- Missingness < 1% (calculated on an array-specific basis for array-specific
  variants)
- HWE p > 1e-7
- MCPI = Manual Cluster Plot Inspection. These are variants that we have looked
  at the cluster plots for and see problems. We haven't looked at all variants.

The "gaf" column indicates variants whose allele frequencies differ
substantially from gnomAD NFE. This was performed for a subset of PTVS. We
matched PTVs to PTVs annotated in gnomAD (gnomad.exomes.r2.0.1.sites.vcf.gz)
based on genomic position, reference, and alternate alleles and compared the
allele frequencies in the UKB and gnomAD by (1) performing a Fisherâ€™s exact
test using the minor allele counts from the 337,208 UKB subjects and the minor
allele counts from gnomAD and (2) calculating the log odds ratio of observing
the minor allele in the UKB versus gnomAD. We stratified PTVs by minor allele
frequency into the following three bins: (0.01%, 0.1%], (0.1%, 1%], (1%, 50%].
For bin (0.01%, 0.1%], we removed PTVs with Fisher p < 1e-7 and an absolute log
odds ratio greater than 3. For bin (0.1%, 1%], we removed PTVs with Fisher p <
1e-7 and an absolute log odds ratio greater than 2. For bin (1%, 100%], we
removed PTVs with Fisher p < 1e-7 and an absolute log odds ratio greater than
1. The values in this column are

- NA: The variant was not considered for this filter.
- PASS: The variant passed this filter.
- FAIL: The variant failed this filter.

The "mgi" column stands for manual gnomAD inspection. For this column, we 
manually reviewed a subset of PTVs that we could not match to the gnomAD exome
data (gnomad.exomes.r2.0.1.sites.vcf.gz) on the gnomAD browser to determine
whether they were likely to accurately type a PTV in gnomAD. This column has a
few different values:

- NA: We didn't manually inspect this variant.
- PASS: The PTV was present on the gnomAD browser but was not included in the
  exome data and the allele frequencies between UKB and gnomAD matched
reasonably.
- NOT_PTV: The UKB array likely typed a non-PTV.
- FAIL: We marked variants as failed if the variant was not present on the
  browser, the variant was multiallelic, the allele frequencies differ
drastically between UKB and gnomAD, or other signs that the array genotypes may
not be accurate relative to the annotation.

The column "ld_indep" indicates whether a variant is part of the LD-pruned set
of variants. LD pruning was performed using plink with "--indep 50 5 2".
