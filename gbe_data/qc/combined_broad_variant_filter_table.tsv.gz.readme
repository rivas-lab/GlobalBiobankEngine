This file contains the same variants and columns as variant_filter_table.tsv.gz
but also includes variants that were used for the Broad GWAS runs. The
annotations and statistics for the "Broad variants" were created by the Broad
group. There are two additional columns in this file: "broad" indicates whether
the variant was annotated by us or by the Broad. "imp_info" is the imputation
score. Some statistics/annotations may be missing because they were not
calculated for some variants.
